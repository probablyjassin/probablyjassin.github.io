Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm 18 and I study computer science while also working in IT.

I enjoy coding things just because I'm interested.

This website is the place where I present these things and write about them, or anything else I want to!

## About me

I finished school in June 2024, and since October of the same year I'm attending [vocational/dual education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education), where I go to Uni for 3 months at a time, and then work for 3 months to then swap back again, for 3 years total. I hope to learn a lot more about IT/Computer Science and eventually work in IT.

In Uni I learn the theoreticals of Computer Science

At work I will learn more about the Infrastructure and Security side of things

And in my free time, I enjoy coding up all the interesting things I feel like trying out

- lots of websites
- working with databases
- my own url shortner
- hosting a mailserver
- discord bots
- a python library

And now that I started blogging about my journey, you can read about it [here](/blog).
