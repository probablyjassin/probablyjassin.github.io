Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm :age and I study computer science while also working in IT.

I enjoy coding things for fun and I wanna learn as much as I can.

This website is the place where I present these things and write about them, or anything else I want to!

## About me

I completed my education in school in June 2024, and since October of the same year I'm attending [vocational/dual education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education), where I go to Uni for 3 months at a time, and then work for 3 months to then swap back again, for 3 years total. I hope to learn a lot more about IT/Computer Science and eventually work in IT.

At Uni I learn the theoreticals of Computer Science (math is killing me rn), and at work I get to dive into hands-on experience.

In my free time, I work on my homelab, coding projects and this website.

- hosting a mailserver
- discord bots
- working with databases
- my own url shortner
- lots of websites
- a python library
- selfhosting everything

And now that I started blogging about my journey, you can read about it [here](/blog).
