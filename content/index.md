## Work in progress!

I'm rewriting my entire website to become more of a blog than a showcase.

This is set up with NuxtJS and it's `content` module to make writing my content easier.

This is written in markdown and then rendered to HTML at build time.

More coming soon\~

# Nuxt Studio

I just managed to set up Nuxt Studio in order to improve my experience with deploying this project, which is really cool!

I'll probably end up writing a blog post (or multiple) about the whole website creation itself
