title: Why My Uni Timetable Sucks - And How I Made It Better
description: As with most Schools and Universities (especially in Germany), my
  Unis website is very old. Of course, it's okay and understandable that they
  aren't running their website on the latest and greatest JavaScript library.
  But shouldn't organizations as important as these at least have a half-decent
  website? These are my biggest problems with my uni's page, and what I did to
  improve my experience.
